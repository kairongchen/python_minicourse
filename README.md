# The course consists of 5 classes, covering 7 chapters:
- [Chapter 1: Getting Started](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20Started.ipynb)
  starts with the python basic knowledge, including ipython, terminal commands, and Jupyter Notebook basics. 
  - [Chapter 1b: Getting Started to Research](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%201b%20-%20Getting%20Started%20to%20Research.ipynb) introduces how an IU researcher can get access to the computing or university subscribed resources, like supercomputer and WRDS subscription. A simple "Hello World" example with job-sending code on Carbonate is provided. I also include a simple SQL request to pull data from the WRDS.
  
- [Chapter 2: Data Structure and Functions](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%202%20-%20Data%20Structure%20and%20Functions.ipynb) introduces you the basic python built-in data structures, functions, files and operating system.

- [Chapter 3: Numpy Basics](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%203%20-%20Numpy%20Basics.ipynb) deals with numpy `ndarray` (n-dim array). It contains comparisons between ndarray and built-in list, matrix operations, and linear algebra functions.  

- [Chapter 4: Pandas and Data Cleaning](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%204%20%E2%80%93%20Pandas%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb) introduces the pandas DataFrame and how we can use it for data cleaning work, such like dealing with missing data, duplicates, etc.
 
- [Chapter 5: Pandas Data Wrangling](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%205%20%E2%80%93%20Pandas%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb) is the chapter that explains more on panel data analysis. More specifically, it includes combining and merging dataset, group operations, time series data, and plotting. At the end, I wrap all things up in a Compustat example.
  - *Note that you need WRDS subscription to get access the Compustat dataset. You can find the code of pulling wrds data in the notebook. I didn't include the corresponding sample data here.*
 
- [Chapter 6: String Manipulation and Regular Expression](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%206%20-%20String%20Manipulation%20and%20Regular%20Expression.ipynb) is a short chapter that introduces string basics, and regular expression.

- [Chapter 7: Web Scraping](https://github.com/kairongchen/python_minicourse/blob/main/Chapter%207%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb) shows you some web scraping basics and tools. I use FOMC statement as the example, which is publicly available on Federal Reserve website.
